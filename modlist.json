It worked better with the RPD even though it's a smaller stage.<br/>Ofc it's not perfect, you might even fall through the ground on some places. And it doesn't have any geoxpath2 actions.<br/>I'm not planning to do more ports from mgs3ds except maybe Groznyj Grad. I might add the background mountains later but not sure. <br/>Anyway, enjoy."
